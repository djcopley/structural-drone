            <p>An autonomous approach to building inspection.</p>
        </header>

        <p style="text-indent: 40px">
            Conventional approaches to building inspection are laborious, costly, and dangerous. As it stands, an
            inspector has to personally travel around any building he would like to inspect; furthermore, in the case of
            a particularly tall building, he would have to be elevated to thoroughly survey the external surfaces of the
            structure. This process is slow, expensive, and potentially dangerous.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">
            On the contrary, the use of an automated drone for such a task would be faster, cheaper, safer, and overall
            more convenient for everyone involved. The drone will be able to fly itself around a designated building and
            accurately identify any flaws that are externally visible. This will include features such as cracks in
            walls, clogged gutters, broken windows, and the like.

                <h4>User Interface</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        As one of the core requirements of the project, the drone must be operable using a user
                        interface of some kind
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This will allow the operator to navigate the drone, configure inspection or navigation
                                settings, or access data from the drone’s flight.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                This should be written in a more familiar programming language such as Python or
                                MATLAB
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The drone should be able to communicate in the same capacity as what has been stated above via
                        the use of an app on an Android phone.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This should allow for interoperability as many individuals have access to or are
                                familiar with Android phones
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The drone furthermore may be operable using a web server, allowing users to configure the drone
                        or access data without a physical connection to the drone
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Image Processing</h4>
                <p>
                    The drone uses image processing in order to isolate and identify relevant information for the
                    operator, which will take place in three steps
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The first operation that the device must be able to perform is to identify what portions of the
                        video data taken may be relevant to the inspection of the structure
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This should greatly reduce the amount of video data that needs to be processed and
                                analyzed
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Secondly, the device must have a system of video stabilization and a means of positionally
                        identifying Regions of Interest (ROIs) to further inspect and record
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This will require a degree of machine learning as it will be up to the drone’s
                                discretion to choose what areas are worthy of being investigated more
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The system must be able to extract high-quality images from the processed video feed for direct
                        analysis by the operator
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This will also require machine learning processes, as the computer must identify the
                                most helpful or relevant pieces of information to provide to the operator, without
                                missing any
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4>Drone Navigation and Path Planning</h4>
                <p>
                    The drone must be able to fly and navigate around the building which it is inspecting, which
                    will be achieved in three steps
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The drone must be operable using a remote controller, either via a radio controller or
                        a WIFI-connected computer
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The drone must be capable of semi-autonomous flight, allowing the user to designate
                        the drone’s flight path and ROIs, which would then be inspected by the drone without direct
                        control
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The drone should be capable of fully autonomous, self-planning flight
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                With this mode, the drone will be given a set of parameters, and it will then generate
                                its own flight path and ROIs through observation
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The drone should also have its own proximity obstacle detection and safe takeoff/landing
                        protocols
                    </li>
                </ol>
