        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">Conventional approaches to building inspection
            are laborious, costly, and dangerous. As it stands, an inspector has to personally travel around any
            building he would like to inspect; furthermore, in the case of a particularly tall building, he would have
            to be elevated to thoroughly survey the external surfaces of the structure. This process is slow, expensive,
            and potentially dangerous. On the contrary, the use of an automated drone for such a task would be faster,
            cheaper, safer, and more convenient for everyone involved. The drone will allow a user to plug a device into
            their laptop and give the program some basic instructions, then receive a streamlined output of video data
            that they can use in lieu of performing a manual inspection. The user will not have to physically move in
            order to investigate the building for flaws, they can stay in one place and observe the process from a
            comfortable or convenient location. This drone additionally makes the inspection of taller buildings more
            feasible, as the operator will not have to elevate themselves in order to achieve a close investigation of
            the outer surfaces of the building. Additionally, any data that is recorded by the drone can be conveniently
            stored and later accessed by the user. Ultimately, our goal with this product is to reduce the risk,
            inconvenience, and potential overhead of having to perform a relatively simple task such as a building
            inspection.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="12">Building inspections have always been
            necessary, in almost any industry – nowadays, however, they are almost always performed via the use of a
            drone. Conventional approaches to building inspection are laborious, costly, and dangerous. Building
            inspectors may have to traverse obstructive or treacherous terrain, and as a result they may have to use
            ladders, construction lifts, or even constructed scaffolding. All of these things have associated risks –
            they can take long amounts of time, incur liabilities which companies have to insure, they can be dangerous
            for inspectors to use or climb – sometimes there could simply not be enough space to bring in the necessary
            equipment. Using an inspection drone, however, inspectors can acquire high-quality videos of buildings
            without endangering themselves or using any other overhead. This solution offers the added benefit of being
            able to save the high-quality footage for later review.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="14">Our project brings this idea to the next level.
            Often the drones that are used are manually controlled, meaning that the operator must constantly be within
            line of sight and appropriate range of the drone. Our drone, however, is autonomous. Using an integrated
            flight-controller software, our operator sets the flight path and sends the drone on its way, up and around
            the building. A gimbal mounted on our drone stabilizes a camera, which records the nearby building and
            streams the video data back to the ground control station. Within the ground control station, this video
            data is presented to the operator; meanwhile, our two-stage feature analysis system is run in the
            background, identifying relevant features, and highlighting them for the user. Identified objects, such as
            gutters and windows, are outlined in the video feed for the operator to see, and a trained deep neural
            network identifies whether this specific feature is nominal or defective. If a feature is determined to be
            nominal, the drone simply continues with its mission. If the feature is defective – that is to say, a window
            is cracked or a gutter is clogged – the drone pauses its mission and waits for the user to allow it to
            continue, storing its stabilized video footage.</p>
        <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="16">The driving idea behind this drone is to bring
            an even more convenient and thorough approach to building inspection, while developing a novel method of
            machine learning implementation. Our goal is to make an easily-operable, low-risk, and sophisticated
            solution to the commonplace issue of building inspection.</p>

            Sometimes QGroundControl can interfere with the GoPro video stream. If the skeyes GUI fails to launch, start
            by quitting both QGroundControl and the Skeyes application. Next make sure that the computer is connected to
            the GoPro wifi network. Next, launch the skeyes application and wait for the graphical user interface to
            display. Finally, start QGroundControl.</p>
